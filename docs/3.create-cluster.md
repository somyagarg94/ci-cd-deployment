# Build the Kubernetes cluster

## 1. Create Infrastructure

To create our infrastructure execute the following commands:

```
$ make create
```

You will see: 

```
$ gcloud init
```
gcloud init is used for initial setup of gcloud and to create new or reinitialize gcloud configurations. You can choose your project here and deploy your applications here.
In this demo, I am using "us-east1-c" zone.

This will also install helm locally, it may ask for your password.
## 2. Check if Helm is running

```
$ helm version
```

You should see:

```
Client: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.8.0", GitCommit:"14af25f1de6832228539259b821949d20069a222", GitTreeState:"clean"}
Server: &version.Version{SemVer:"v2.8.0", GitCommit:"14af25f1de6832228539259b821949d20069a222", GitTreeState:"clean"}
```
