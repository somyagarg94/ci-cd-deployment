# Installing Helloservice

To install helloservice execute the following command:

Check if helm is running:

```
$ helm init
```

You should see:

```
Happy Helming!
```
## 2. Deploy using Helm

To deploy helloservice execute the following command:

```
$ make deploy
```

You should see:

```
NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```

## Get the External-IP of Ingress

Execute the following steps, (it may take some time to get the External-IP address of LoadBalancer)

```
kubectl get service
```

You should see:

```                  
NAME           TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
helloservice   LoadBalancer   10.23.247.143   35.196.174.62   80:31315/TCP   14m
kubernetes     ClusterIP      10.23.240.1     <none>          443/TCP        42m
```

You can copy the external IP of the helloservice service, and paste in host file.
## Update hostfile (local machine)

We need to edit our hostfile to allow access to helloservice.

Please follow the steps below to make the necessary changes.

Add the following lines to the file (where 35.196.174.62  is the External IP address of your ingress node):

```
35.196.174.62  helloservice.example.com
```
